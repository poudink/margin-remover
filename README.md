One big web design trend that I hate is the one where websites decite to limit the amount of horizontal space they use for literally no reason. So much space just being wasted, so much more you could see on screen if the huge pointless margins could just go away. So, I made this for myself, then decided to share it because why not. Supports a few websites that I sometimes use. Will add more as I continue browsing. May not cover every case for those sites either, because I have a pretty small screen (1366x768) so sometimes the margin just won't be visible to me.
Supports:
<ul><li>DuckDuckGo
<li>Github
<li>Kuriblog
<li>MediaWiki
<li>MyAnimeList</ul>

Also, this is my first userscript and one of my only uses of CSS ever, so I have no clue what I'm doing and this whole thing is done very poorly. If you have any advice to give me so I can improve this, please share away. If you have any website you'd like to add, feel free to open a pull request. If you have any website you'd like me to add, open an issue and I'll probably look into it.
